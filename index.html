## Today

<hr>

1. Docker basics (~10%)
1. Development workflow (~90%) - Docker setup, local development, continous integration/delivery

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>We're covering a lot of material today. Don't worry if you miss something or don't fully understand a concept since this entire workflow will be featured in a blog post on Real Python - https://realpython.com. The post will go live on 02/10/2015. I would recommend just watching me go through the workflow, and then recreate it on your own next week when the post goes live.</aside></script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is Docker?

<hr><br>

#### Containers AND Images AND Dockerfiles. Oh my!

![oh my](images/oh-my.jpg)

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>With Docker you can easily deploy a web application along with the app's dependencies, environment variables, and configuration settings - everything you need to recreate your environment quickly and efficiently.
- A *Dockerfile* is a file that contains a set of instructions used to create an *image*.
- An *image* is used to build and save snapshots (the state) of an environment.
- A *container* is an instantiated, live *image* that runs a collection of processes.</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Docker?

<hr>

1. Version control for infrastructure
1. Easily distrubute/recreate your entire dev env
1. Build once, run anywhere - aka The Holy Grail!

![holy grail](images/holy-grail.jpg)

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>In other words, you can truly mimic your production environment on your local machine. No more having to debug environment specific bugs or worrying that your app will perfrom different in production.</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Workflow!

<hr><br>

![steps](images/steps.jpg)

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>1. Code locally on a feature branch
1. Open a pull request on Github against the master branch
1. Run automated tests against the Docker container
1. If the tests pass, manually merge the pull request into master
1. Once merged, the automated tests run again
1. If the second round of tests pass, a build is created on Docker Hub
1. Once the build is created, it's then automatically (err, automagically) deployed to production</aside></script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Part 1 - Local Setup
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Docker Setup

<hr>

Let's get Docker up and running!

<br>

Enter **Boot2Docker** - a *lightweigh*t Linux distribution designed specifically to run Docker ([Install](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/))

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>Mac and Windows users need this in order to power Docker containers. Once installed, test it out - `boot2docker version`</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fig Up!

<hr>

![steps](images/fig.png)

- **[Fig](http://www.fig.sh/)** builds and run services needed for your application.
- Install it via pip and then define the services within a *fig.yml* file.

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>- Fig handles the building and running of multiple services. It makes it super easy to link services together running in different containers.
- Once installed, test it out - `fig --version`
- First, we build the image from the "web" directory and then mount that directory to the "code" directory within the Docker container. The Flask app is ran via the `python app.py` command. This exposes port 5000 on the container, which is forwarded to port 80 on the host environment.
- Next, the Redis service is built from the Docker Hub "Redis". Port 6379 is exposed and fowarded.</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Build and Run

<hr><br>

### `$ fig up`

![fig logo](images/figup.png)

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>- This command builds an image for our Flask app, pulls the Redis image, and then starts everything up.
- Now we can view our app in the browser by navigating to the address associated with the boot2docker VM - `boot2docker ip`.
- At this point we've set up our local environent. Next, let's add CI into the mix.</aside></script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Part 2 - Continuous Integration
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Docker Hub

<hr>

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a repository of Docker images.
- It acts as a CI server since you can configure it to create a build every time you push a new commit to Github.

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>- Docker Hub is like Github, only for Docker images
- CI: Let's test this out. I'll add a simple assertion to the test, commit, and push. This will generate a new build on Docker Hub - which should be successful.
- That said, we should use a *true* CI server to catch errors before we generate any builds on Docker Hub.</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CircleCI

<hr>

![circleci logo](images/circleci.png)

- **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)** is a continuous integration and delivery platform that supports testing within Docker containers.
- [Getting started with CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/getting-started) - super simple setup
- Add a *circle.yml* config file

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>- Given a Dockerfile, CircleCI builds an image, starts a new container, and then runs tests inside that container.
- Sign up with your Github account, then add the Github repo to create a new project. This will automatically add a webhook to the repo so that anytime you push to Github a new build is triggered.
- Essentially, we create a new image, run the container, then test - first that the web process is running (the app is live) and then that our unit tests pass.</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Feature Branch Workflow

<hr>

Example...

1. Create the branch
1. Make changes locally
1. Issue a Pull request
1. Manually merge once the tests pass
1. The tests run again on the master branch
1. Once the second round passes, a new build is triggered on Docker Hub

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>- Before you go through this process, you need to configure Docker Hub to only create a new build after Circle CI runs the tests on the master branch - and they are successful. This is detailed in the blog post.
- `git checkout -b circle-test master`
- `self.assertNotEqual(four, 6)`
- `git push origin circle-test`
- Create PR
- Merge
- Check for new build</aside></script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Conclusion

<hr>

- So, we went over a nice development workflow that included setting up a local environment coupled with continuous integration.
- What about the final piece - deliverying this app to the production environment? Make sure to check out the blog post @ [realpython.com](https://realpython.com) on 02/10/2015!
